<h1 align="center"> GAS COST CALCULATOR PROJECT </h1>

We used gas price data with **Machine Learning** to create an app that took in user inputs of a road trip and gave the user a total cost for gas for that trip. The data was collected from www.eia.gov (https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=240691) via API.

Finally, we used **JavaScript**, **JQuery**, **Ajax**, and **Google Maps API** to build the app and take in user information and push back total gast cost.
